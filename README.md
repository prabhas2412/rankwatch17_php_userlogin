# User Sign-in & Sign-up
I have made a form page with Full Name (input), Email Address (input), Password, Mobile Numbe (input), Age (input), Gender (dropdown), Address (textarea), Country list (dropdown), State list (List Based on country selection use AJAX).
I have used Javascript form validation.
These credentials will be used to perform login authentication based on the email and password provided at time of sign up.
After login you will be able to see the all information stored of that user.
